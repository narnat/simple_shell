.Nd It takes no arguments
.Sh DESCRIPTION

Custom shell is imitation of sh, with some built-ins, it has limited functionality. This is a two week project from holbertonschool. It has basic functionality and executes ELF files from PATH variable, even though when full path to the executable is not provided. Also, this shell can handle commands with arguments

.Nm "This is the decription from actual manual page of shell:"


    	  The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.
     It is the program that is running when a user logs into the system (although a user can select a different shell with the chsh(1)
     command).  The shell implements a language that has flow control constructs, a macro facility that provides a variety of features in
     addition to data storage, along with built in history and line editing capabilities.  It incorporates many features to aid interac‐
     tive use and has the advantage that the interpretative language is common to both interactive and non-interactive use (shell
     scripts).  That is, commands can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put into a file and the file can be executed
     directly by the shell.

.Nm Lexical Structure

     The shell reads input in terms of lines from a file and breaks it up into words at whitespace (blanks and tabs), and at certain
     sequences of characters that are special to the shell called “operators”.  There are two types of operators: control operators
     and redirection operators (their meaning is discussed later).  Following is a list of operators:

           Control operators:
                 & && ( ) ; ;; | || <newline>

           Redirection operators:
                 < > >| << >> <& >& <<- <>

.Sh Examples
This shell runs any executable file from the PATH environmental variable, because it prepends directories to the commands. It means that you can execute commands such as
.Ar ls, pwd, which and so on.

    For full list of commands go to your directories of your PATH environmental variable. For example, /bin directory contains most of the commands, like ls, pwd, which and grep.
.Nm ls -l /tmp
    This input will result in the list of files and directories in /tmp directory in long format

.Nm BUILT-INS

.Nm env
    It is built-in command which will print environmental variables

.Nm setenv
    A command which will set environmental variable

.Nm unsetenv
    Unsets environmental variable

.Nm exit
    Exits from the shell, it takes unsigned int as a
.Ar exit status
